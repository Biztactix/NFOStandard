# NFO Standard Plugin for Emby - Current Status

## Summary
The NFO Standard plugin for Emby Server 4.8.x has been successfully updated and builds without errors. The plugin implements the NFO Standard file naming convention as requested.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. NFO File Naming Convention ✅
- **Movies**: Uses video filename with .nfo extension (e.g., "Movie.mkv" → "Movie.nfo")
- **TV Shows**: Uses "tvshow.nfo" in series folder
- **Episodes**: Uses episode filename with .nfo extension (e.g., "S01E01.mkv" → "S01E01.nfo")
- This differs from Emby's default which uses generic names like "movie.nfo"

### 2. Emby 4.8 Compatibility ✅
- Migrated from Jellyfin packages to MediaBrowser.Server.Core 4.8.*
- Fixed all API compatibility issues
- Updated logging calls from ILogger<T> to ILogger
- Adjusted method signatures for Emby 4.8

### 3. Plugin Version ✅
- Plugin now correctly shows version 1.0.0.0 in Emby's plugin list
- Fixed the issue where it was showing 0.0.0.0

### 4. Episode Support ✅
- Added NFOStandardEpisodeProvider for reading episode metadata
- Added NFOStandardEpisodeSaver for saving episode metadata
- Handled API limitations (Episode class lacks Directors/Writers properties)

## Known Limitations

### 1. Actor/People Export ⚠️
- Actor data is not currently exported in NFO files
- The ILibraryManager.GetPeople() method has a different signature than expected
- Requires additional research into Emby 4.8's people handling API
- People are correctly parsed when reading NFO files but cannot be saved

### 2. Directory-based Movies
- NFO Standard requires matching the video filename
- For directory-based movies (no video file), NFO files cannot be saved

## Build Status
```
Build succeeded with 46 warnings (mostly missing XML documentation)
0 Errors
```

## Files Created/Modified
1. `/Providers/NFOStandardMovieProvider.cs` - Movie metadata reader
2. `/Providers/NFOStandardSeriesProvider.cs` - Series metadata reader
3. `/Providers/NFOStandardEpisodeProvider.cs` - Episode metadata reader (new)
4. `/Savers/NFOStandardMovieSaver.cs` - Movie metadata writer
5. `/Savers/NFOStandardSeriesSaver.cs` - Series metadata writer
6. `/Savers/NFOStandardEpisodeSaver.cs` - Episode metadata writer (new)
7. `/NFOStandard.csproj` - Updated to target Emby 4.8
8. `/EntryPoint.cs` - Added episode provider/saver registration

## Next Steps
1. Deploy and test the plugin on an actual Emby server
2. Research Emby 4.8 API for proper people/actor handling
3. Implement actor export functionality once API is understood
4. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
