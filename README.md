## Overview

The NFO Standard is designed to provide a consistent and comprehensive metadata format for media files. By adopting this standard, applications can save countless hours reinventing the wheel and ensure compatibility across different platforms.

## Features

- **Unified Structure**: A single, comprehensive format for .nfo files.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable to cover fringe use cases.
- **Modularity**: Separate XSLT files for different types of content (Movies, TV Shows, Porn Videos, Anime).
- **Open Source**: Licensed under The Unlicense, making it free for everyone to use and contribute.

## File Structure

- `main.xsd`: The master XSD file that includes or imports other XSD files based on the content type.
- `common.xsd`: Contains common custom content types.
- `person.xsd`: Contains common elements for the person types associated with the content.
- `library.xsd`: Contains common elements for Library Software to use.
- `adult.xsd`: Specific schema definitions for adult video content.
- `anime.xsd`: Specific schema definitions for anime content.
- `audiobook.xsd`: Specific schema definitions for audiobook content.
- `movie.xsd`: Specific schema definitions for movie content.
- `music.xsd`: Specific schema definitions for music content.
- `musicvideo.xsd`: Specific schema definitions for music video content.
- `podcast.xsd`: Specific schema definitions for podcast content.
- `tvshow.xsd`: Specific schema definitions for TV show content.
- `video.xsd`: Specific schema definitions for general video content.

## Example XML File
This is an example of how to use the XSDs to reference it so that it's easy for others to understand and apps to extract the content.
